TODO

--Add reset password functionality
--Extension to automatically find jobs
--Instead of rejected, have one of the options be "Close Job", this will trigger 2 more options:
    I declined, Rejected, plus one third choise, Delete Job. The first 2 options will be application
    status and selected either will simply archive the application. Selecting the third one will
    delete the application without changing its status. 


BUGS TO FIX 
--Limit how much description text is shown
--fix login css
--state and city dropdowns when adding application looks ugly
