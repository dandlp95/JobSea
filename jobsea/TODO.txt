TODO

--Add filters (based on modality, location, salary, job status, etc)
--Add reset password functionality
--Adjust page based on view size and update CSS
--Seach bar functionality
--Extension to automatically find jobs
--Add job information (stuff you entered when you created the application)
    when extending the job application, below the updates
--Instead of rejected, have one of the options be "Close Job", this will trigger 2 more options:
    I declined, Rejected, plus one third choise, Delete Job. The first 2 options will be application
    status and selected either will simply archive the application. Selecting the third one will
    delete the application without changing its status.

--Limit how much description text is shown
--css on buttons
--fix login css
--show link
--updates should show status preview
--searchh j
--state and city dropdowns when adding application looks ugly
